##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I put anything I thought of as a main component of the page in base.css, anything that needed specific placemet in layout.css, and anything that had a class in modules.css

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No.
